# Cadence Radio (http://www.kenellorando.com)
## Background
Cadence is an online radio heavily inspired by 4chan/8ch's [R/a/dio](http://r-a-d.io/). The project is my first endeavour to practice a full-range of IT-skills. It currently utilizes technologies in front-end design with HTML and CSS, site scripting with JavaScript, and some networking and server management using Windows Server 2016. Back-end work for a music database is also currently being built using the MySQL RDBMS. The database is filled with thousands of non-redundant entries of music metadata using a populator tool I programmed in Java.

Future plans for the radio include a front-end database query feature (PHP) and an advanced back-end request bot (C#).
