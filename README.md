# Cadence Radio (http://www.kenellorando.com)
## Background
Cadence is an online radio heavily inspired by 4chan/8ch's [R/a/dio](http://r-a-d.io/). The project is my first endeavour to practice a full range of IT-skills. Completing the imagined full scope of the project will ideally give me more experience with front-end design, site scripts, programming, databases, web servers, server operating systems, and cyber security.
