#   ERROR    = 40
#   WARNING  = 30
#   INFO     = 20
#   DEBUG    = 10

# Logging format
# See https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.Formatter for documentation

# These two options control logging to either the console or the disk

# If both are disabled, then the used logger will be configured so that no log entry can be emitted,
#   and logs will be configured to be sent to stdout.

# If log_to_console is enabled, this option sets the stream to which logging is written.
# Can either be 'stdout' or 'stderr'

# If log_to_disk is enabled, these options set the location to which logs are written
# Logs are written to a rotating file: The configured file is current.

# This can be any of S, M, H or D, for seconds, minutes, hours, and days.

# If special_request_timeouts is set, these are the IP addresses which may submit requests using the tag system
# If they submit a request without a tag, the IP address will be used instead.
# Be careful about adding machines to this list - We don't check tag formats at all.
# A malicious machine could just use a UUID and flood us with requests.
# Basically, only add machines to this list that you or someone you trust controls.
# This should be a comma-delimited list of addresses, with no other formatting (except whitespace).
# If newlines are included, indent the lines which are still part of the list (not beyond the equal sign).
# If this is set to "None", the behavior will be equivalent to setting special_request_timeouts to off.
special_request_whitelist = None
# Example valid configuration:
# special_request_whitelist = 127.0.0.1, 192.168.0.1, 8.8.8.8

# special_request_whitelist = 127.0.0.1,
#                        192.168.0.1,
#                        8.8.8.8

# If this is set, the whitelist is ignored, and all IP addresses are allowed to make special requests
# I highly recommend to leave this off in production, but it could come in handy during debugging.
# Note that even if this is set, if special_request_timeouts is off, the behavior will be off.
special_request_force_enable = off

# Any address on this list is forbidden from submitting ARIA requests
# The list is a comma-separated list of IP addresses, as in the special_request_whitelist
# The list may be None to disable this behavior
# The list may also include a special request tag to block requests from that tag
# The server will not tell the server whether it's tag-blocked or address-blocked.
# However, the special-request protocol doesn't require the client to make sure tags represent the same user forever, only during a session.
#   (CadenceBot, for example, allows the user to change their tag at will by changing their Discord username)
# Therefore, I'd be careful about doing this, since any blocking could unintentionally block 'good' users.
request_blacklist = None

# If request_blacklist is not None, and special request timeouts are permitted,
#   these tags may submit requests even if they come from a blacklisted IP.
# Note that, for non-special requests, this can be used to un-blacklist an IP (as it will override the blacklist)
# There's no good reason to do this that I can think of.
# That said, I won't go through the extra work needed to prevent this, so consider it a feature.
# It won't, however, work if special_request_timeouts is off, or if no address is allowed to submit one.
request_whitelist = None

# If this is not set to "None", this header is used to identify clients
# (Useful if behind a proxy, to set to a proxy-delivered header with the client's IP)
# If the header is not found, the default behavior (using the socket peer address) will be used.
# Two headers are processed with special behavior:
#   X-Forwarded-For is stripped for the leftmost IP address (the original client; ignoring in-between proxies)
#   Forwarded is parsed for the first address identified by a "for".
# Any other header is treated as if the entire header value is the client identifier

# Example (Strictly standards-compliant server):
# client_identification_header = Forwarded
# Example (Cloudflare):

# If 0 or negative, timeouts will be entirely disabled (no checking or storing will be performed)

# If set, the server will respond to files that are not found that end in 'coffee' with '418 I'm a Teapot'
# If off, these requests will just get a 404 like any other such request.
# Therefore, I consider this a harmless easter egg.
enable_418 = on

# If set, the server will check POST requests.
# If they correspond to ARIA endpoints, the equivalent function will be performed.
# Otherwise, 405 Method Not Allowed will be returned, informing the client that they may only use GET or HEAD at that location.
# If off, POSTs are treated just like any other unknown method, and will be met with 501 Not Implemented
# Basically, this option is an on/off switch for the entire ARIA API
# (Disabling this will break ARIA, an integral part of Cadence. Do so with caution.)
enable_aria = on

# Controls the blocksize (in bytes) HTTP requests are done in
# Smaller chunks have less overhead. Larger chunks result in larger latency before the beginning of a request or response can be processed
# Note that small chunks will cause the server to 'hang' while processing requests, as the receive loop will repeat many times
# Also note that there is a known bug wherein very small chunks (less than the mid-twenties) can cause the server to hang permanently or crash.
# This is because the current code depends on the entire Content-Length header being fetched in one block.
# If this condition is not met, the server will miss the header entirely, causing it to try to find it forever (unless the connection is disconnected).
# Python docs recommend 4096 as this size.
# In any case, it should be a power-of-two. Some servers use 8192 or even 16384.
HTTP_blocksize = 4096

# Controls the maximum number of connections in the connection accept backlog
# Python will allow this many connections to be waiting to be accepted before dropping them
# Generally, we should keep this fairly small - If the server can't keep up with incoming connections, it's better to drop connections than leave them waiting for a long timeouts
# However, if the server consistently drops connections, you should increase the backlog.

# For formatting of the list, see the comments for special_request_whitelist
# For formatting of an HTTP header, see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers
# Regardless of configuration, the server transmits the following headers:
#   Date, Connection, Content-Type, Content-Length, Accept-Ranges
# As well as, conditionally:
#   Warning, Retry-After, X-Queue-Position, Allow, Location
# If caching is enabled (via commandline or configuration), these headers are also sent:
#   Cache-Control, ETag, Last-Modified
# I'm not sure what happens if you send a duplicate header. It's probably client dependent.
# I recommend not sending those headers. Your configuration will very likely misbehave.
additional_headers = Server: Cadence purpose-built webserver,

# If this is off, byte-range requests will be disabled.
# The server will explicitly tell clients it doesn't support them.
# Doing this will prevent these requests from being used to resume downloads of large files, potentially increasing overhead.

# This option controls threading
# The server will spawn up to this many threads per operation, per selection
# That is to say, each time the server decides to do work on some sockets, it will spawn up to this many threads to read with, and up to this many threads to write with
# Which is also to say, the maximum number of threads is twice this number
# If this is too high, the overhead of creating threads could slow the serrver down more than the parallelism is a benefit
# If this is 0, the server will handle all the connections serially, each connection one after another
# Probably, the number of cores your machine has is a fair start point for this setting
max_threads = 4

# These options control content encoding
# The server itself manages how encoding is done, but when it's done is configurable.
# First, the server will only compress files above this many bytes in size
# 1460 bytes is how much data can be sent in one Ethernet frame (one MTU, after TCP/IP overhead)
# Compressing things smaller than this is basically a waste

# This option controls the select timeout
# Basically, if no sockets are available for read within this many seconds (can be a float), the select is aborted.
# Instead, the program will automatically return to assemble a new set of selectable connections
# Lowering this setting increases overhead (since the old set is recreated), but increases responsiveness for connections added asynchronously to selects.
# Raising this setting lowers overhead, but causes some connections to have to wait longer than needed.
# This can be set to None to disable timeouts, but this causes such connections to wait until another connection is ready and processed to be handled.
